.SH NAME
ffpcomplex - This program filters FFP profiles based on the complexity of features.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "ffpcomplex [" "OPTION" "] ... [" "FILE" "] ..."
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This utility can be used to filter high or low complexity features
from the FFP matrix. The upper and/or lower limits can be set 
using a complexity cuttoff (the default) or a probability cutoff can be used
assuming a normal  distribution.  Probability limits are
the cummulative probability values from the normal distribution
found from the calculated mean and stdev of the input FFP. 
Requires key-valued FFP input.
FFPs will be read from standard input if no options are supplied and 
.B ffpcomplex  
is called non-interactively (i.e. as part of a pipeline) or with a "-" in the 
argument list. The default input type is assumed to be nucleotide sequence.
.SH OPTIONS

.B -s, --stats
.PP
Print statistics describing the FFP complexity distribution to
standard error.
.TP
.BI "-u " "FLOAT, " "--upper=" "FLOAT"
.PP
.RI "The upper threshold limit for feature complexity where " "FLOAT" " can be "
.RI "any complexity value or for probability distributions, in which case" " FLOAT "
can range from 0 to 1 -- representing the probability in a cummulative distribution
function.
.RB "This can be used in conjunction with " "-l" " or by itself."

.SH EXAMPLES
The main usage of this progam is for filtering out low complexity
features, for example features which primarily represent repetitive
DNA might be need to be filtered out -- since they don't provide much
useful phylogenetic signal. To get an idea about what the complexity
of the words in your FFPs are you can use the 
.B \-s 
option to get a statistical report, which includes the mean, range
and standard deviation of complexity.  The complexity of a feature
is determined by finding the total entropy of all individual sub features
for all 
.I k
less than 
.I l,
which is the length of the feature.  For example given the feature
.PP
.CODE GCGCGCGC
.PP 
determine the entropy of 
.IR "k" "=1,"
which which is H(1) = f(G)log f(G) + f(C)log f(C).  Next determine the entropy
of all 
.iR "k" "=2," 
sub-mers, H(2) = f(GC)log f(GC) + f(CG)log f(CG).  Repeat for all 
.I k 
less than
.IR "l" "."   
The total complexity of the 
.IR "l" "-mer" 
is H(l) = H(1) + H(2) + ... + H(l-1).
Here we filter out all features with complexity less than 1.0:
.PP
.CODE ffpry -l 5 *.fna > vectors
.CODE ffpcomplex -l 1.0 vectors > vectors.filt
.PP
Features with high and low complexities can 
be removed simultaneously.  This example excludes all features which
with complexity greater than 10 and less than 2.
.PP
.CODE ffpcomplex -u 10.0 -l 2.0
.PP
Finally we can assume that the complexities of the features used follow a specific
distribution (usually the normal distribution is the appropriate choice).
We can exclude features that lie outside a certain range of the cummulative
probability distribution.  Here we exclude all features which lie below
10% and above 95% of the normal CDF.
