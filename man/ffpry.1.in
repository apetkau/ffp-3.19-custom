.SH NAME
ffpry \- This program generates an FFP vector of nucleic acid RY-coded features.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "ffpry [" "OPTION" "] ... [" "FILE" "] ..." 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Given no options the default behavior of the program is to
generate a Feature Frequency Profile (FFP) using features of length
10 from FASTA input.  The FFP will contain the counts of nucleic acid features coded
in purine(R)/pyrmidine(Y) format.  By default the feature keys will
be printed alongside the feature counts. FASTA sequences will be read
from standard input if no options are supplied and 
.B ffpry 
is called non-interactively (i.e. as part of a pipeline) or with a "-" in the 
argument list.  In default mode features are stored in either the forward or
reverse complement direction based upon alphabetical preference.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "\-l " LEN ", --length=" LEN	
Changes the default length of features to 
.IR "LEN" "." 
The default length is 10. Maximum length allowed in 40.
You may overide this maximum length by setting (and exporting)
the environmental variable MAX_WORD_SIZE to a different value.
.TP
.BI "\-f " FILE ", --feature-list=" FILE
.pp
Changes the behavior of the program to read a list of features from 
.IR "FILE" "."
Features can be space or newline delimited. 
As of v3.00 features are now matched,coded and reported in both the forward and reverse strand. To disable this behaviour use the 
.B -r 
option. By default the feature list is RY coded.
.TP
.BI "\-w " STR ", --mask=" STR
.pp
Use character 
.I STR
of length 
.I LEN
which specifies a character mask for the features. For example "1111101111" means to ignore the 6th character
 of a character feature. Feature maskings functions in combination with both 
.B -d 
and 
.BR "-r" "."  
.TP
.BI "\-z " K ", --rand-mask=" K
.pp	
Create a random weight mask which allows up to K mismatches.  No greater than the word length in mismatches is allowed. The weight mask is printed to standard error at the beginning of execution.  This option is cummulative with both options -d and -r.
.TP
.BI "\-s " INT ", --rand-seed=" INT
.pp
Seed the random number generator, to make randomization operations like 
.B \-z 
predictable across different runs.  This option is cummulative with both
options 
.B -d 
and 
.BR "-r" "."
The defaul seeed to the random number generator is (system time) * (process ID).
.TP
.B \-q, --quiet
.pp
Run in quiet mode.  Suppresses printing to standard error.
.TP
.B \-d, --disable
.pp	
Disable RY coding to use ATGC coding.
.TP
.B -m, --multiple
Calculate FFPs for multiple sequences in the input file.  Sequences must have their own FASTA '>' header.
.TP
.B -r, --disable-rev
Disable counting of reverse complement features.
.PP
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
The FFP phylogeny tools are designed to be used as filters in a pipeline.
To create a key-form FFP use this syntax:
.PP
.CODE ffpry -l 3 test1.fna
.PP
This will generate an FFP of the form
.PP
.CODE RRY 4 RRR 5 YYR ...
.PP
To generate a profile of several nucleic acid sequences
.PP
.CODE ffpry -l 3 test1.fna test2.fna test3.fna
.PP
Or more succinctly
.PP
.CODE ffpry -l 3 test*.fna
.PP
The profile for each fna file will be produced on a newline delimited row.
in the following format:
.PP
.CODE AAATGA	2	ATAGTA	4	ATGGGG	1 ...
.CODE AAACGA	2	ATAGCA	1	CTGAGG	3 ...
.PP
This format is a key-value FFP.  
.PP
The utility
.B ffprwn 
which row normalizes data  must be presented with columnar data -- This
data format contains only the count values and no keys.
The columns represent a feature and each row of the FFP input corresponds
to the counts of that feature in the individual FASTA files.
This data format is recognized by several utilities, therefore you
must convert a key valued FFP into a columnar format using
.B ffpcol
.PP
For example several commands can be piped together to produce a 
divergence matrix representing FFP similarity
.PP
.CODE ffpry -l 4 test*.fna | ffpcol | ffprwn | ffpjsd
.PP
If mismatches are desired at specific positions within a feature
a mask can be applied by using the
.B \-w
option.  The format of the mask is a string of 1's and 0's which
specify whether a match is required at that postion or whether
mismatches are allowed.  For example:
.PP
.CODE ffpry -l 5 -w "10110" test*.fna 
.PP
This specifies that mismatches are allowed at the 2nd and 5th postions
in every feature.  
.PP
The 
.B \-z
option can be used to randomly create a mask with 
.B n 
number of mismatches.  The mask is printed to stderr by 
default.  The example below redirects the output of standard
error to a file.  
.PP
.CODE ffpry -l 5 -z 2 test*.fna 2> mask
.PP
To disable the default RY coding use the 
.B \-d
option which will use 4 base ATGC coding.
.PP
If the frequencies for a small set of features is desired then the
.BI "\-f " "FILE"
option can be used. 
.I FILE
specifies the name of a file containing a list of features (RY or ATGC coded).
The list of features can be tab, space or newline delimited.  
Note the length of the features must also be specified using the 
.B \-l
option as well.    
.PP
By default all of the sequence data in a particular file is merged into one
FFP. Multiple fasta records (multiple fasta sequences in a single file)  are parsed as one single sequence (for example, consider
the case of multiple contigs in a single genomes).
If your fasta files contain multiple sequences separated by '>' style records headers 
.RB "and you wish to produce FFPs for each record then specify the " "-m" " option."
.SH L\-MER FEATURES
Features are stored in a mixture of the forward and reverse complement direction. For
example, if the feature:
.PP
.CODE GTGTAGT
.PP
is encountered in the forward direction in the sequence it will be stored by
default in the hash table and reported in the output in the reverse complement direction, which is:
.PP
.CODE ACTACAC
.PP
This decision is based upon hash function precedence, whichever direction has the 
smallest hash index will be used.  This form of hashing allows for homology detection,
independent of gene strandedness.  The behavior can be disabled with the 
.B \-r
option, which will force all features to be stored in the forward direction.
Also, by default features are stored in RY coded form.  This has been shown to
improve phylogenetic signal in a number of studies especially if highly varying 
rate of mutation are suspected among different taxa.  Additionally RY coding
is much faster, but is a compromise between speed and sensitivity.  Likewise
this feature can be disabled with the 
.B \-d
option.
