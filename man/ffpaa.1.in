.SH NAME
ffpaa \- This program generates an FFP vector of amino acid features.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "ffpaa [" "OPTION" "] ... [" "FILE"  "] ..."
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Given no options the default behavior of the program is to
generate a Feature Frequency Profile (FFP) using features of length
4.  By default amino acids are divided and counted using 11 equivalent
classes: (ST),(DE),(KQR),(IVLM),(FWY),C,G,A,N,H,P [Li et al. (2003) Peds, 16. 323].
For multicharacter classes the amino acid is reported in the ffp output by the first character 
in the series.  For example, (IVLM) is represented by I.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "\-l " "LEN" ", --length=" "LEN"
.RI "Changes the default length of features to " "LEN" ". The default length is 4,"
with a maximum length allowed of 40.
You may overide this maximum length by setting (and exporting)
the environmental variable MAX_WORD_SIZE to a different value.
.TP
.BI "\-f " "FILE" ", --feature-list=" "FILE"
Changes the behavior of the program to read
.RI "a list of features from " "FILE" ". Features can"
be space or newline delimited.
.TP
.BI "\-w " "STR" ", --mask=" "STR"
.RI "Use character " "STR" " of length " "LEN" " which specifies"
a character mask for the features. For example "1111101111" means to ignore the 6th character of a feature.
.TP
.BI "\-z " "INT" ", --rand-mask=" "INT"
Create a random character mask which allows up to
.IR "INT" " mismatches.  No greater than " "LEN"
in mismatches is allowed. The character mask is
printed to standard error at the beginning of
execution.
.TP
.BI "\-s " "INT" ", --rand-seed=" "INT" 	
Seed the random number generator. Randomization 
.RB "operations like " "-z" " are fixed and  predictable across different runs."
By default the seed is (system time) * (process ID).
.TP
.BI "\-q, --quiet"
Run in quiet mode.  Suppresses printing to standard error.  This effects option
.BR "\-z" "."
.TP
.BI "\-d, --disable-classes"
Disable classing of amino acids. Use 20 symbol amino acid coding.
.TP
.B "\-m, --multiple"
.IR "FILE " "contains multiple FASTA sequences and an FFP is desired for each sequence."
.TP
.B "\-h, --help"
Display help message.
.TP
.B "\-v, --version"
Display version.
.PP
.SH EXAMPLES
The command:
.PP
ffpaa -l 3 file*.faa
.PP
Will produce a output of this form, using features of length 3:
.PP
.CODE AGK 2 ASS 3 AKF 4 ...
.br
.CODE AKK 3 AKS 2 AKF 5 ...
.PP
There will be one FFP line for each 
.CW .faa 
file supplied in the argument list and each will be printed in the order
specified on the command line.  Note, the above uses the order in which the
shell (i.e. bash, cshell, etc.) expands the file argument wildcard, 
.C *.faa.
In the even this is undesired, the format format below can also be used
to explicitly control the ordering:
.PP
.CODE ffpaa -l 4 file1.faa file2.faa file3.faa
.PP
A mask can be applied to feature counting to allow mismatches using the 
.B \-w 
command.  For example if a mismatch is to be allowed
at the second and fourth positions of a feature with length 
.IR "l" "=6, " "this can be done via:"
.PP
.CODE ffpaa -l 6 -w "101011" file*.fna
.PP
If mismatches are desired but no specific pattern is necessary
then one can use the
.B -z
option.
.PP
.CODE ffpaa -z 2 file1.faa file2.faa.  
.PP
This will produce a random mask of at least two mismatches (within a feature with
a default length of 4).  The mask
is printed to standard error. To save the mask for
later reference, you can direct standard error to a file.
For example:
.PP
.CODE ffpaa -z 3  file*.fna > vector 2> mask
.PP
The redirection
.CW >2
sends standard error to the file 
.CW mask.
.PP
.PP
To disable classing of amino acids, (i.e. make FFP consider
.RB "R and K different -- and therefore count each symbol separately) use the " "-d" " option"
.PP
.PP
The utilities in the FFP package can be used as fully
qualified filters and can be used to build pipelines.
The pipeline below will create a Phylip infile format distance
matrix, using the Jensen Shannon divergence:
.PP
.CODE ffpaa -l 7 file*.fna | ffpcol -a | ffprwn | ffpjsd -p taxa.txt > infile
.PP
Note, the desired taxa names must be specified in the argument to 
.BR "\-p" ","
see
.BR ffpjsd(1)
.
.PP
To disable classing of animo acids you should incorporate the 
.B \-d 
option into the above pipeline -- both in the call to 
.B ffpaa 
and 
.B ffpcol.
.PP
.CODE ffpaa -l 7 -d file*.fna | ffpcol -a -d | ffprwn ...
.PP
Bootstrap and jacknife resampling can be done with the
ffpboot program, see 
.BR ffpboot(1).
