.TH ffptree 1 "[@]DATE[@]" "Version [@]VERSION[@]" "FFP PHYLOGENY"
.SH NAME
ffptree \- Build Neighbor Joining or UPGMA trees from distance matrix input.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "ffpdf [" "OPTION" "] ... [" "FILE" "] ..."
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Calculate a Neighbor Joining tree or UPGMA tree.  This program is 
compatible with phylip style distance matrix infiles and the output
produced by 
.B ffpjsd 
with option 
.B -p.
The NEWICK style tree is written to standard out, while progress reports
and a human readable tree are written to standard error.  
Input matrices can be read from standard input, a pipe or a file. The
input file can contain multiple sets of matrices.
FASTA sequences will be read
from standard input if no file arguments are supplied and 
.B ffptree
is called non-interactively (i.e. as part of a pipeline) or with a "-" in the
argument list.    
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-n, --upgma
Build a UPGMA tree. The default is to build a neighbor joining tree.
.TP
.B \-l, --lower
Use lower input triangle.  Use only the lower half of the input matrix
and assume symmetry.
.TP
.B \-u, --upper
Use upper input triangle.  Use only the upper half of the input matrix
and assume symmetry.
.TP
.B \-t, --print-tree
Disable printing of a human readable tree to standard error.
.TP
.B \-p, --progress
Disable printing of tree build progress to standard error.
.TP
.B \-d, --print-data
Enable printing of the input data before tree build standard error.
.TP
.B \-y, --symmetrize
Symmetrize input data matrix, by averaging upper and lower triangles.
By default, the input matrix is checked for symmetry, but is disabled
with 
.B \-y.
.TP
.B \-q, --quiet
Disable printing of human readable tree, tree build progress and warnings to
standard error.
.TP
.BI "\-o " "TAXAN" ",  --outgroup=" "TAXAN"
Rearrange tree to place taxon
.I TAXAN
at the outgroup position of the tree.
.I TAXAN
is an integer ranging from 1 to the number of
input taxa.
.TP
.BI "\-O " "OUT" ",  --out=" "OUT"
Write Newick format tree to file 
.I OUT.
By default, the tree is printed to
standard out.
.TP
.BI "\-P " "OUT" ",  --out-prg=" "OUT"
Redirect tree build progress to a file
.I OUT.
By default, progress is printed to
standard error.
.TP
.BI "\-w " "WDTH" ",  --precision=" "WDTH"
Specify the decimal precision used in reporting
branch lengths in the Newick format tree. The
default precision is 8 digits.
.TP
.BI "\-j[" "S" "],  --jumble[=" "S" "]"
Jumble input order or species in matrix.
Optional argument
.I S 
can be used to provide a fixed random seed
value to the random number generator, but the
default value is the (system time) * (process ID).
.TP
.BI "\-m[" "N" "],  --multiple[=" "N" "]"
Limit tree building to the first
.I N
sets.
Without option 
.I N 
use all input sets, which
is the default behavior.  With
option 
.IR "N" ","
use up to 1 to the 
.IR "N" "th set."
The default is to use all input sets from
the input file without using option 
.B \-m.
.TP
.B  "\-v, --version"
Display version information.
.TP
.B  "\-h, --help"
Display help message.
.PP
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
This utility can be placed at the end of a pipeline of FFP utilities
to directly generate tree output.  The example below supressed printing 
of the build progress and the human-readable to standard error with the
.B \-q option.
.PP
.CODE ffpry -l 4 *.fasta | ffpcol | ffprwn | 
.CODE ffpjsd -p species.txt | ffptree -q > treefile
.PP
Note, you must have defined a taxa name file
with option
.B \-p
in the call to
.B ffpjsd
to pipe input to
.B ffptree.  
For additonal information see,
.BR ffpjsd(1).  
If you wish to view and save the build progress for later review, then
redirect standard error to a file.
.PP
.CODE ffpry -l 4 *.fasta | ffpcol | ffprwn | 
.CODE ffpjsd -p species.txt | ffptree > treefile 2> progress
.PP
Multiple input sets can be created and supplied in the same
input file. Typically these will be pseudo-replicates generated
via the 
.B ffpboot
utility.  If the file
.CW input
contains 100 pseudo-replicates or input sets then by default
.B ffptree
will read all the input sets and generate trees for each. 
The 
.B \-m 
option can be used to control how many input sets are processed.
.PP
.CODE   ffptree < input      # Generate all 100 trees
.CODE   ffptree -m < input   # Generate all 100 trees
.CODE   ffptree -m50 < input # Generate first 50 trees.
.PP
Note the absence of an intervening space between 
.b \-m
and 
50.  This is the format for all options which take an
optional argument.
