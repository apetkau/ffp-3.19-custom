.SH NAME
ffpre \- This program calculates the relative entropy between an
.IR "l" "\-2" 
Markov model estimation of frequency and the observed frequency
of features.  This is used to calculate an upper limit of 
.I l 
to use for phylogenetic inference.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "ffpre [" "OPTION" "] ... [" "FILE" "] ..."
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Given no options the default behavior of 
.B ffpre 
the progam is to generate the relative entropy value (RE)  (also known as the Kullbach-Leibler divergence)
of feature frequencies using 
.IR "l" "=10" 
and estimates of the frequencies using 
.IR "l" "=9" 
and 
.IR "l" "=8" 
to provide the estimate.  To calculate the 
relative entropies for a range of 
.IR "l" "," 
use the shell script supplied
.B ffpreprof
with the FFP package, which calculates a relative entopry profile.
This utility is used to help determine
the proper feature length range to use for phylogenetic inference.
When the relative entropy approaches zero, this indicates that the
frequency of all features can be determined by using the frequencies
of the 
.IR "l-" "1" 
and 
.IR "l-" "2" 
feature frequencies (i.e. features have the
same frequency as slightly shorter words).  This indicates that each 
.IR "l" "," 
.IR "l-" "1," 
and 
.IR "l-" "2" 
feature occurs in the same context within the
sequence.  Therefore using lengths longer than when the RE is zero
provide no additional information. The default assumes nucleic acid
sequence input.  
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "\-l " "LEN" ", --length=" "LEN"
.RI "Changes the default length of features to " "LEN" ". The
default length is 10.
Maximum length allowed in 40.
.TP
.B \-d, --disable-ry
Disable RY coding to use ATGC coding.
.TP
.B \-r, --no-reverse
Disable reverse complement matching. Applicable to 
nucleotide sequence only.
.TP
.B \-a, --amino 
Input is amino acid sequence.
.TP
.B \-t, --text
Input is a text file. 
.TP
.B \-v, --version
Print program version.
.TP
.B \-h, --help
Help message.
.PP
.SH EXAMPLES
To calculate the relative entropy between the estimate
and observed feature frequencies:
.PP
.CODE ffpre -l 4 test*.fna
.PP
To calculate the RE for a range of lengths use
.BR "ffpreprof" "."
Note that the RE may oscillate above or below zero - but
given long enough
.I l
it will eventually approach zero.  In mathematical terms
the limit of 
.IR "KL" "(" "l" ")"
as
.I l
approaches infinity is zero.
.PP
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
None.
