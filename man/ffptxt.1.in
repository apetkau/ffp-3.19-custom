.SH NAME
ffptxt \- This program generates an FFP vector of text data.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "ffpaa [" "OPTION" "] ... [" "FILE"  "] ..."
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Given no options at all the default behavior of the program is to
generate a Feature Frequency Profile (FFP) of text data, using 26
alphabet letters, removing all non-alphabetic characters.  The 
default feature length is 6.
Text will be read from standard input if no options are supplied and 
.B ffptxt
is called non-interactively (i.e. as part of a pipeline) or with a "-" in the 
argument list.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "\-l " "LEN" ", --length=" "LEN"
.RI "Changes the default length of features to " "LEN" ". The default length is 6."
The maximum word size is 40.
You may overide this maximum length by setting (and exporting)
the environmental variable MAX_WORD_SIZE to a different value.
.TP
.BI "\-f " "FILE" ", --feature-list=" "FILE"
Changes the behavior of the program to read
.RI "a list of features from " "FILE" ". Features can"
be space or newline delimited.
.TP
.B "\-h, --help"
Display help message.

.SH EXAMPLES
The command:
.PP
.CODE ffptxt -l 3 file*.txt
.PP
Will produce a output of this form, using features of length 3:
.PP
.CODE hel 2 elo 3 low 4 ...
.CODE thi 3 ism 2 sme 5 ...
.PP
There will be one FFP line for each .txt file
.PP
This format can also be used:
.PP
.CODE ffptxt -l 4 file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
.PP
The utilities in the FFP package can be used as fully
qualified filters and can be used to build pipelines.
This pipeline will create a phylip infile format distance
matrix, using the Jensen Shannon Divergence:
.PP
.CODE ffptxt -l 7 file*.txt | ffpcol -t | ffprwn | ffpjsd -p > infile
.PP
.RB "Please note the use of the" " -t " "option in ffpcol to specify text."
.PP
Bootstrap and jacknife resampling can be done with the
ffpboot program.
.PP
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
None.
