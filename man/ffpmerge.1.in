.SH NAME
ffpmerge - This program merges the rows of an FFP into a single row.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "ffpmerge [" "OPTION" "] ... [" "FILE" "] ..."
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The behavior of the program is to merge all rows of the FFP.  The
FFP can be a columnar or key-valued FFP.
FFPs will be read from standard input if no options are supplied and 
.B ffpmerge 
is called non-interactively (i.e. as part of a pipeline) or with a "-" in the 
argument list.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 
.B -d, --disable
Disable classing of amino acid and nucleotide sequences. 
.TP
.B -k, --keys
Print key value pairs. Default is output in columnar format.
.TP
.B -a, --amino
Input FFPs are animo acid sequences.
.TP
.B -t, --text
Input FFPs are text.
.TP
.B -v, --version
Display version.
.TP
.B -h, --help
Display help message.

.SH EXAMPLES
The main usage of this program is to merge separately calculated
FFPs from different parts of a large genome.  For example consider
a multi-chromosome genome.
.PP
.CODE ffpry -l 5 chr1.fna > chr1.vector
.CODE ffpry -l 5 chr2.fna > chr2.vector
.CODE ffpmerge chr*.vector > chrall.vector
.PP
The primary advantage of computing the vectors in this way
is that separate chromosome vectors can be calculated on
different processes and the process of 
.I "l" "-mer" 
counting can be distributed across a multi-processor
architecture.  If you have many small fasta files which
you need to merge there is no clear advantages to using the
count and merge process shown above. In this case, concatenating
the files together on the fly is more effective:
.PP
.CODE cat *.fna | ffpry -l 5 > merged.vector
