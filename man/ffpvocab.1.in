.SH NAME
ffpvocab \- This program determines the number of features which have frequencies above a threshold value.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "ffpvocab [" "OPTION" "] ... [" "FILE" "] ..."
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Given no options, the default behavior of the program is to
print out the average number of features with frequencies greater than
two in all rows.  This value is defined as the number of vocabulary features.
FFPs will be read from standard input if no options are supplied and 
.B ffpvocab 
is called non-interactively (i.e. as part of a pipeline) or with a "-" in the 
argument list.  If a multi-row FFP is supplied then the default behavior is to
average the number of vocabulary features across all rows.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "\-f " "INT" ", --freq-thresh=" "INT"
Threshold to count a feature.  The default value is 2, which means a feature 
must have a frequency greater than or equal to 2, in order to be counted.
.TP
.B \-h, --help
.PP
.SH EXAMPLES
To count the number of features that occur 3 or more times
in the ffp:
.PP
.CODE ffpry -l 5 file.fna | ffpvocab -f 3 
.PP
To calculate word usage for a range of lengths
use
.B ffpvprof.
