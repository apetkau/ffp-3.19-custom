.SH NAME
ffpfilt - This program filters FFP profiles based on numeric/statistical properties.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "ffpfilt [" "OPTION" "] ... [" "FILE" "] ..."
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This utility can be used to filter high or low frequency features
from the FFP matrix. The upper and/or lower limits can be set 
using a raw frequency cutoff or a probability cutoff which
assumes either a normal or an extreme value distribution. 
Requires key-valued FFP input.  Note you should use this as a replacement for 
.B ffpcol 
in any pipelines (rather than in addition to) as 
.B ffpfilt 
produces columnar output.  Columnar output can be disabled with the
.B --keys
option. FFPs will be read from standard input if no options are supplied and 
.B ffpfilt 
is called non-interactively (i.e. as part of a pipeline) or with a "-" in the 
argument list.  The default input is assumed to be nucleotide sequence.


.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -s, --stats
.PP
Print statistics describing the FFP frequency distribution to
standard error.
.TP 
.B -z, --zeros
.PP
Include zeros is calculation of statistical parameters. When few
features are observed, but a long feature length is used this 
has the effect of skewing the feature distribution towards zero.
.TP
.BI "-u " "FLOAT, " "--upper=" "FLOAT"
.PP
.RI "The upper threshold limit for raw frequencies where " "FLOAT" " can be "
.RI "any frequency value or for probability distributions, in which case" " FLOAT "
can range from 0 to 1.
.TP
.BI "-l " "FLOAT, " "--lower=" "FLOAT"
.PP
The lower threshold limit.
.TP
.B -f, --freq
.PP
Use raw frequencies for filtering
.TP
.B -n, --norm
.PP
Use a normal distribution for filtering
.TP
.B -e, --evd
.PP
Use an extreme value (Gumbel) distribution for filtering
.TP 
.B -d, --disable
.PP
Disable classing of amino acid and nucleotide sequences. 
.TP
.B -a, --amino
.PP
Input FFPs are animo acid sequences.
.TP
.B -t, --text
.PP
Input FFPs are text.
.TP
.B -k, --keys
.PP
Force key,value output.  Default it columnar output.
.TP
.B -h, --help
.PP
Display short help message.
.TP
.B -v, --version
.PP
Display version information.

.SH EXAMPLES
The main usage of this progam is for filtering out high frequency
features, for example large numbers of prophage copies in a genome
might be need to be filtered out -- since they don't provide much
useful phylogenetic signal.  Here we filter out all features which
occur more than 5 times using the 
.B \-u
option.
.PP
.CODE ffpry -l 5 *.fna > vectors
.CODE ffpfilt -f -u 5 vectors > vectors.filt
.PP
Features which occur rarely and features which occur frequently can
be removed simultaneously.  This example excludes all features which
occur more than 10 times and less than 2 times.
.PP
.CODE ffpfilt -f -u 10 -u 2
.PP
Finally we can assume that the feature frequencies follow a specific
distribution.  Usually the extreme value distribution [EVD] is the appropriate choice,
however you should confirm what the distribution of your feature frequencies are
yourself.  We can exclude features that lie outside a certain range of the cummulative
probability distribution.  Here we exclude all features which lie below
10% and above 95% of the EVD cummulative distribution function.
