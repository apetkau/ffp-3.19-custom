.TH ffpdf 1 "[@]DATE[@]" "Version [@]VERSION[@]" "FFP PHYLOGENY"
.SH NAME
ffpdf \- Outputs clade distinguishing features for specified clades.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "ffpdf [" "OPTION" "] ... [" "FILE" "] ..."
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This is used to discover distinguishing (or diagnostic) features (DFs)
that are present in a specific clade and no other clades.  This
technique was used in the paper: Sims GE, and Kim SH (2010), PNAS, 108,
8329-34. This ultility should be used as a filter for the output of
.BR "ffpry" "," 
.BR "ffpaa" ","
or
.B ffptxt
using key-valued FFPs input.  Given no file arguments, the FFP input can
be piped into STDIN.  If a group (i.e. clade) file is specified but no group is
specified then, the group file is ignored.  You must query individual
groups separately.  Output is a tab delimited list of the features.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "\-f " "FILE" ",  --group-file=" "FILE"
Specify clades/groups.
FILE is a newline delimited file which indicates which row of the FFP file 
belongs to which clade.  FILE has a format specifying one newline delimited symbol per
row.  See 
.B EXAMPLES 
below.  If not specified then all rows are assumed to be
in the same clade.  Use in conjunction with option
.BR "\-g" "." 
.TP
.BI "\-g " "STR" ", --group=" "STR"
Select the clade where the DF search will be performed.  If not specifed all rows of
the FFP are assumed part of one clade.
.TP
.BI "\-p " "FLT" ", --percent=" "FLT"
Specify a fractional cutoff for the percentage ( i.e. 50%  = 0.5) of
a group members which which need to have a feature for it to be considered a DF. The
default is all group members or 1.0.
.TP
.B  "\-v, --version"
Display version information.
.TP
.B  "\-h, --help"
Display help message.

.SH EXAMPLES
A distinguishing feature is a feature which is present in all FFPs of a 
given group, but absent in all other groups.  Given these example rows from
an FFP matrix,
.PP
.CODE Taxon 1 ...   ATG 3  CAC 2  TGA  3 ...
.CODE Taxon 2 ...   ATG 2  CAC 1  TTG  1 ...
.CODE Taxon 3 ...   ATG 4  TGC 3  GGA  2 ...
.PP
and the additional information that taxa 1 and 2 belong to group A and
taxon 3 belongs to group B, we can give an example of a DF.
The feature,
.CW ATG
,is not a DF for either group A or B, since it is
present in all groups.  However feature 
.CW CAC
is a DF for group A, since it is present in only group A and not group B.  Likewise feature 
.CW TGA
and
.CW TTG 
are not DFs of group A because neither is present in all
members of that group.  
.PP
To find distinguishing features in an FFP, first you must create an FFP,
using one of the feature counting utilities, 
.BR "ffpry" ","
.BR "ffpaa" ","
or 
.BR "ffptxt" "."
The example below illustrates the method for RY-coded nucleotide sequences,
where we want to find features which are universally shared among all taxa
specified in the FFP input file.
.PP
.CODE ffpry -l 6 test*.fna > vector
.CODE ffpdf vector > dfs
.PP
or alternatively, combining the separate commands as one pipeline:
.PP
.CODE ffpry -l 6 test*.fna | ffpdf > dfs
.PP
The above example assumes every row (genome, species, or sequences) is
a member of the same group (clade).  For multiple clades, use the 
.B --group-file 
option to specify the clade structure.  This is defined
by building a newline delimited group-file definition.
Lets say there are 5 genomes and there are two
clades, the 2nd and 3rd rows of the FFP, belong to clade A and the
remainder belong to clade B., then the group file should have the
format below
.PP
.CODE $ cat groupfile
.CODE B
.CODE A
.CODE A
.CODE B
.CODE B
.PP
Now that clades have been defined we can extract out the DFs for
clade A or B separately (A in this case below).
.PP
.CODE ffpry -l 6 test*.fna | ffpdf --group-file="groups.txt" --group="A" > dfs.A
.PP
Multi-character alphanumeric symbols can also be specified for group names.
Note however, any whitespace will be stripped from group names.
.PP
Also, note that by default a DF is defined as a feature which is present in
all members of a group.  This defintion can be relaxed slightly by using the
.B \-p 
option to specify the percentage of taxa within a given group which must have a feature
in order for it to be considered a DF.  For example if we wanted to find out which 
features are present in 2 out of 3 taxa in group B we can use this syntax:
.PP
.CODE ffpry -l 6 test*.fna  | ffpdf -p 0.66 --group-file="groups.txt" --group="A" > dfs.B
